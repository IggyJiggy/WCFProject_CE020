# WCFProject_CE020
Application with CRUD functionality using WCF for Semester-6 SOC project

This project was mentored by Prof. Apurva Mehta and Prof. Prashant Jadav.

**A little about this project:**  
 This is an employee information storing application made with the help of WCF.
 There are 2 solutions in this repo:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**EmlployeeManagement** and **Application**.  
 The EmployeeManagement is where the services are stored, and Application is the client.  
 Please ensure that the EmployeeManagement is running before build and run on Application.
